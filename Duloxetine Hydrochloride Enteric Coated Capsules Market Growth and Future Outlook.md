The increasing understanding of the therapeutic benefits of duloxetine, particularly in treating fibromyalgia and generalized anxiety disorder, has led to higher adoption rates among healthcare professionals. Additionally, the shift towards more patient-centric treatment plans has emphasized the importance of using medications that minimize gastrointestinal side effects, an area where enteric-coated formulations excel. This has spurred demand for duloxetine capsules that are designed to protect the drug from the acidic environment of the stomach, thereby enhancing bioavailability and efficacy.</p><p>From 2024 to 2032, the market is projected to experience steady growth, with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5.2%. The market size, valued at approximately USD 1.2 billion in 2024, is anticipated to reach about USD 1.9 billion by 2032. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing healthcare expenditure, the rising focus on mental health, and ongoing research and development activities that are expanding the therapeutic applications of duloxetine.</p><p>Furthermore, the increasing awareness campaigns and educational programs aimed at both patients and healthcare providers are expected to contribute to the growth of the duloxetine hydrochloride enteric coated capsules market. As more individuals become aware of mental health issues and seek treatment, the demand for effective and well-tolerated medications is likely to rise, further fueling market expansion.
